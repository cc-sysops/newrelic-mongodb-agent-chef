    #  If you are running MongoDB without authentication, please delete from now to the end
    #  of the file.
    #
    #  If you *are* running authentication on MongoDB please enter the following.  In order
    #  to monitor MongoDB, on an authenticated environment, an admin user is required.  To
    #  add an admin user, just add the user to the admin database like so from the MongoDB CLI:
    #
    #  > use admin
    #  > db.addUser("myadminuser", "myadminpassword")
    #
    username: "root"
    password: ""
